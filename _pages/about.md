I am currently pursuing my PhD in Computer Vision at the <a href="https://ethz.ch/">ETH Zurich</a>, <a href="https://v4rl.ethz.ch/">Vision for Robotics Lab</a> advised by <a href="http://www.margaritachli.com/"> Margarita Chli</a>. 

My research interest is in Computer Vision and I am currently investing the use of neuromorphic event cameras in the visual SLAM problem.  While event cameras are really fast and efficient, their output is asynchronous and sparse in constrast to the images acquired by traditional cameras. My doctoral studies are focused on developing novel Computer Vision algorithms that can fully exploit the characteristics of this new sensing modality.
